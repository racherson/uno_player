;; Strategy rules

;; Basic rules

;;Compare two cards to determine if they're the same color
(<==     (sameColor ?card1 ?card2)
    (isa ?card1 ?cardColor)
    (isa ?cardColor PlayingCardColor)
    (isa ?card2 ?cardColor))

;;Compare two cards to determine if they have the same number (version 1) or symbol (version 2)
(<==    (sameSymbol ?card1 ?card2)
    (isa ?card1 ?cardSymbol)
    (isa ?cardSymbol NumberCardType)
    (isa ?card2 ?cardSymbol))
(<==    (sameSymbol ?card1 ?card2)
    (isa ?card1 ?cardSymbol)
    (isa ?cardSymbol SpecialCardType)
    (isa ?card2 ?cardSymbol))

;;TO DO: METHOD TO CHECK IF COLOR EXISTS IN HAND (FOR WILD DRAW 4 PLAYING REASONS)

;;Check to see if any cards in the hand are the same color as the top card
(<==    (anySameColorInHand ?card ?))

;;Check to see playable cards in hand (same color, same number/symbol, wild, or wild draw4 and don't have the color)
(<==     (playableCards ?card ?topCard)
    (cardState ?card inHandCard)
    (sameColor ?card ?topCard))
(<==     (playableCards ?card ?topCard)
    (cardState ?card inHandCard)
    (sameSymbol ?card ?topCard))
(<==     (playableCards ?card ?topCard)
    (cardState ?card inHandCard)
    (isa ?card WildTheCard))
;;TO DO: METHOD TO CHECK IF CAN PLAY A WILD DRAW 4 BASED ON WHETHER PLAYED COLOR EXISTS IN HAND
(<==    (playableCards ?card ?topCard)
    (cardState ?card inHandCard)
    (isa ?card wildDraw4)
    )


;; CONSIDERATIONS:
;; 1. How to check if a color is in the hand so know if can play a wild draw 4
;; 2. For playable cards, if a Draw 2 was played must play a Draw 2 or just pick
