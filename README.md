## Instructions for Playing a Game
**1. Initialize Game**

Initialize the game state with the top card in the discard pile and the cards in your hand. To do this, go to the commands tab in Companions and run the following command (InitializeGame ?topCard ?card1 ?card2 ?card3 ?card4 ?card5 ?card6 ?card7) where topCard is the top card in the discard pile and ?card1 through ?card7 are the seven cards you start with in your hand. Here is an example of the InitializeGame command with real entities: (InitializeGame blue2 bluedraw2 blue1 blue3 bluereverse blueskip blue8 blue0) 

**2. Your Turn**

When it is your turn, you can either draw or play a card. Both outcomes will involve commands in the commands tab in Companions. 

If you draw a card, run the following command (selfDrewCard ?card) with the card entity you drew. Here is an example of the selfDrewCard command with real entities: (selfDrewCard red7)

If you play a card, run the following command (selfPlayedCard ?card) with the card entity you played. Here is an example of the selfPlayedCard command with real entities: (selfPlayedCard blue8)

See instruction #4 for how to get recommendations for what card to play on your turn.

**3. Opponents' Turns**

When it is an opponents turn, they can either draw or play a card. Both outcomes will involve commands in the commands tab in Companions. 

If an opponent draws and then plays a card (e.g. they had no playable cards in their hand and the card they drew was playable), run the following command (opponentDrewAndPlayed ?opponent ?card) with the respective opponent and card entities. Here is an example of the opponentDrewAndPlayed command with real entities:  (opponentDrewAndPlayed opponent1 green5)

If an opponent drew card(s), run the following command (opponentDrewCard ?opponent ?quantity) with the respective opponent and number of cards drawn. Here is an example of the opponentDrewCard command with real entities when the previous player played a draw 2: (opponentDrewCard opponent2 2)

If an opponent played a wild card, run the following command (opponentPlayedWildCard ?opponent ?color) with the respective opponent and switched-to color entities. Here is an example of the opponentPlayedWildCard command with real entities: (opponentPlayedWildCard opponent1 RedPlayingCard)

If an opponent plays a card that isn't a wild card, run the following command (opponentPlayedCard ?opponent ?card) with the respective opponent and card entities. Here is an example of the opponentPlayedCard command with real entities: (opponentPlayedCard opponent1 blue3)

**4. Recommendations**

This is the primary purpose of our system.

If it is your turn and you want to know your best move, run the following command (cardToPlay). Then, go back to the status tab in Companions, right-click session-reasoner and select Browse KB. Search "MyNextMoveMt" in the search bar, and open up facts in mt. You will see a fact of the form (nextMove ?card) where ?card is the recommended card to play. Here is what the fact looks like with real entities: (nextMove blue8)
         
          
Alternatively, you can view your recommended move after running the command (cardToPlay) by going to the Query tab in the session-reasoner and running the following query (nextMove ?card) in the context MyNextMoveMt.
